Viewer	Read-only access

⚙️ Architecture
UI Layer: Windows Forms

Business Logic Layer

Data Access Layer

DBManager for centralized DB operations

🧩 Database Structure
Stored Procedures

Views

Triggers

Indexes (on common search columns and compound index on username/password for speed)

🚀 Performance & Code Enhancement Features
Multithreading:

Used Task, Parallel.Invoke, and Parallel.ForEach in CPU-bound operations.

lock used to prevent race conditions where needed.

Async/Await:

Used in some places (even for CPU-bound operations) to practice the concept.

Future extension ready for true I/O-bound operations like file/database access.

Operator Overloading:

Applied on Driver and PenaltyPoints for intuitive use of += / -= operations.

StringBuilder:

Used instead of string concatenation for better memory performance.

Custom Condition Attribute ([Conditional("TestEventLog")]):

Enables tracing/debug output only when TestEventLog is defined.

No need to comment/remove debug code manually.

RegistryKey Helper:

Simplified working with Windows Registry for saving user data/preferences.

Special Comments:

Used to explain complex code in more detail.

🧠 Advanced Concepts Used
🧾 Serialization + Reflection
Stores a snapshot of the original user data to allow rollback to previous state.

🏷️ Custom Attributes
Used to add business validation (e.g., checking that BirthDate → Age ≥ 18).

Used in documentation generator (runs via reflection in debug mode) to list full class info.

📊 Reporting
Admins can view:

All user operations (login, create, edit, delete)

Activity timestamps

System logs and full audit trail

🛠️ Development Environment
IDE: Visual Studio Community 2022

Language: C# WinForms

Database: SQL Server

Libraries Used: System.IO, Resources, Image Processing, Text File Reporting

🧪 UI & Interaction Enhancements
ListView Multi-Select: Assign roles or delete multiple users at once.

TrackBar: To visually represent user permissions.

NotifyIcon: Shows loading progress or system notifications.

BaseForm Inheritance:

All forms inherit BaseForm with shared logic for:

ShowIfAuthorized()

👥 Default Users
Role	Username	Password
Admin	User1	1111
